### Introduction
This is a Solution for PadhAI competition hosted on Kaggle
It very Hard to predict the behaviour of customer buying phones depending upon features for any Machine
This problem can be solved using the Perceptron Model


### Keywords 
Keywords : Perceptron Model, Data Analysis, Satastics, Numpy, Pandas.

## Tools
PreRequirements :
		 LIBRARIES	: Pandas,Numpy, Sklearn, matplotlib, csv.
		 IDE		: Spyder, Jupyter

Abstract

# procedure to run
Procedure : 
	Open the kernel04a6252e21.ipynb file.
	This file Includes Code with a proper documentation


# Evaluation Plan
As this is a Logistic Regression problem
We have to find Accurracy_Score using Sklearn.Metrics


### key Metrics :
Mean Square Error (MSE)—
	It is the average of the square of the errors.
	The larger the number the larger the error.

Absolute errorse(AE)—
	It is a difference between two continues variables



# Optimisation :

### Parameter Tuning
	Tuned No of epoches from 100 to 15000
	Learning Rate from 0.1 to 0.0001
